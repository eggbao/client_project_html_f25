      <h2>Resume Formatting Basics</h2>
      <p>
        If your resume is poorly formatted, it is difficult for any reader (human or computer) to intake the information
        and it becomes too much work for the employer to make a decision. Often times, they will just move on to the
        next candidate. Your overall goal for creating and refresing your resume should be to create a universally
        scannable document where information can easily be found.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most resumes, especially for industry jobs, will be one page. Some academic or non-profit jobs will be open
          to 2 complete pages for a resume. Federal jobs tend to be 5-6 pages. Please see <a
            href="https://help.usajobs.gov/faq/application/documents/resume/what-to-include">this guide on USA Jobs</a>
          for additional information.</li>
        <li>While tempting to get rid of all the white space around the edge, maintain margins for ease of reading and
          strong visuality.</li>
        <li>We know it can be tempting to use cool design tools like Adobe, Figma, or canvas, however, these documents
          are often unreadable by an ATS scanner (even when saved as a PDF). We recommend having a copy that is made in
          a readily accessible and available tool like Microsoft Word or Google docs. In addition, you should always
          save as a PDF to maintain formatting.</li>
        <li>Formatting should be consistent across and between sections. </li>
        <li>Use a standard simple font that is 10-12pt in size. Typical fonts include: Arial, Calibri, Cambria,
          Garamond, Helvetica, etc. We recommend starting with just black text, however, if you are using color make
          sure it is a purposeful choice. </li>
        <li>Lastly, your resume should not contain any pictures or images.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Course projects are incredibly valuable to your career goals. Course projects can amplify your work and academic
        experience to make your stand out to an employer by giving them evidence of applicable and hands on work which
        can amplify your resume to help you market yourself as a the best candidate for the job. Below are a few tips on
        what to mention when including course projects in your resume.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Demonstrate Skills:</strong> Clearly state the skills you developed or utilized during these
          projects. Whether it's technical skills (programming languages, software proficiency), analytical skills,
          problem-solving abilities, teamwork, leadership, or project management, highlight them concisely.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Innovation:</strong> Discuss how your projects involved innovative solutions or
          required creative problem-solving. Employers value candidates who can think critically and find novel ways to
          address challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Teamwork and Collaboration:</strong> If the projects involved teamwork, explain your role within the
          team, how you collaborated effectively, and how your contributions helped achieve project goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication and Presentation:</strong> If applicable, mention any presentations, reports, or
          documentation involved in presenting project findings. Highlight your communication skills and ability to
          convey complex information clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability and Learning:</strong> Describe any instances where you adapted to changes or learned
          new skills during the course of the project. Employers value individuals who can quickly adapt to new
          environments and continue learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant Technologies or Tools:</strong> Specify any tools, technologies, or methodologies you used
          in these projects. This showcases your familiarity with industry-relevant tools and demonstrates your ability
          to apply them in practical settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact and Results:</strong> Quantify the impact of your work whenever possible. For instance,
          mention if your project contributed to process improvement, increased user engagement, cost reduction, etc.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Showcase Initiative:</strong> Highlight any instances where you took initiative, led a project, or
          went above and beyond the requirements of the assignment. This demonstrates your proactive attitude and
          motivation.</li>
