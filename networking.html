        <li><strong>Find Alumni:</strong> Look into your network, both within UMSI and beyond it, for alumni that you
          could potentially network and connect with. This can include your friends, peers, mentors, supervisors,
          LinkedIn connections, and University of Michigan faculty. To find more people to network with, utilize the
          following CDO resources:

        <li><strong>Reach Out & Get a Response:</strong> After finding someone you want to network with, now it is time
          to reach out to them through email. Each contact you connect with is an important and valuable addition to
          your network! Below are some pointers on what to do when writing your email:
          <ul>
            <li>Write a descriptive & enticing subject line.</li>
            <li>Start with context that connects you.</li>
            <li>Clearly state what you're looking for & why you’re reaching out. Do this by being specific on what your
              "ask" is, mentioning why you are reaching out to <em>them</em> in particular, and respecting their time by
              keeping your message short.</li>
            <li>Establish a time frame for a chat with them. It is easier to say yes to 20 minute coffee chat in the
              next 2 weeks than an undefined time commitment.</li>
            <li>Say thank you for their time!</li>

      <h2>Informational Interviews: Using the TIARA Method </h2>
      <p>
        The TIARA method is a framework for planning the questions you will ask in an informational interview. You can
        use this formula to gain information and establish a rapport.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trends:</strong> This opening gives your contact time to reflect. Consider asking about a typical
          activity, the impact of their organization, and how their organization has changed.</li>
        <li><strong>Insights:</strong> Questions about their personal insights help you build a more personal connection
          with the contact. Ask your interviewee about lessons they've learned, what they enjoy about their work, or
          next steps in their career.</li>
        <li><strong>Advice:</strong> Asking for advice can help continue to build rapport and their comments could prove
          helpful for you later in the recruitment process. Consider asking questions about how you can succeed or what
          you can learn from their experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Does your contact have resources or tools they recommend for someone in your
          position? This question gives you reasons to follow up!</li>
        <li><strong>Assignments:</strong> Asking about recommended next steps can give you another reason to follow up
          with the contact. For example, "What kinds of projects seem to add the most value to your organization? I’d
          like to see if I can start doing that kind of work in my classes."</li>

      <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>What if I’m an introvert or find networking uncomfortable?</strong><br>
          Start small and connect with other students or faculty, or attend group events. Preparing questions ahead of
          time and practicing your elevator pitch can boost your confidence. Remember, networking is a skill that
          improves with practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What if I don’t get a response?</strong><br>
          Don’t get discouraged. Response rates for cold messages can be low (around 20%). Try following up once if you
          don’t hear back after a week or two, or consider reaching out to others as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How early should I start networking as a UMSI student?</strong><br>
          It’s never too early! The sooner you start, the more confident and prepared you’ll be when searching for jobs
          or internships. Building genuine connections takes time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How do I leverage career fairs or conferences for networking?</strong><br>Research attendees in
          advance, target specific organizations or alumni, and prepare a few talking points or questions. After meeting
          someone, follow up with a personalized thank-you message referencing your conversation.
        </li>
      </ul>
