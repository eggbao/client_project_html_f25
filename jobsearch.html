      <h2>Industry Recruiting Timeline</h2>

        alt="Students and employers gather in a large event hall with informational banners promoting various companies">
      <p>Recruiting timelines can vary widely by industry. While some employers—like large tech firms and consulting
        companies—participate in on-campus recruiting early in the academic year, many other fields such as libraries,
        archives, government, museums, and nonprofits may hire later or on a rolling basis. This means your job or
        internship search may involve a mix of campus recruiting, external job boards, company websites, and networking.
        Understanding these different timelines and how they relate to your chosen field will help you better plan your
        search and maximize your opportunities. UMSI CDO is here to support you through every stage of the process,
        regardless of where or when you look for positions.
      </p>
      <!--Content taken & modified from UMGPT with the prompt,"i want to write a section for my website on campus and industry recruiting timelines, but i need a short section description on it. So far i have this " On-Campus recruiting is only one way to engage in job recruitment and internship searching. Not all industries participate in on-campus recruitment: Libraries, archives, government, museums and nonprofits do not typically participate in campus recruiting, but that doesn’t mean they don’t hire! Students get jobs & internships by using a combination of these different methods. Many of our students use things like Company websites, external job boards, and their own networking to secure jobs and internships. Generally, your internship will likely involve a combination of these methods! In addition to the opportunities we facilitate, UMSI CDO is also here to help you understand and navigate these “external” methods." but it is not really saying that industries typically have different recruiting months"

      <h2>Finding Job/Internship Postings</h2>
      <p>There are several different places to search for job/internship postings. In this section, we'll highlight some
        of the most common places UMSI students find opportunities. </p>
      <h3>CareerLink
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          UMSI CareerLink offers on-demand access to career support: internships, jobs, career advising, career-building
          resources, special events and more. This online tool is exclusively for enrolled UMSI students and alumni.
        </li>
        <li>Some of the most important features to know on CareerLink to help you search for job/internship postings
          include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>OCI and Job Listings Tab</strong> - This is the tab where you'll go to search for opportunities
              in CareerLink. OCI stands for on-campus interviews, and job listings are postings of opportunities that
              you can apply for. </li>
            <li><strong>Filters</strong> - We recommend using filters within OCI and job listings to streamline your
              search as much as possible. One of our favorite filters is the "Job Function" filter, which can be found
              by clicking "Add Filter" and then clicking "Job Function." The Job Function filter allows you to search by
              the type of work you want to do (i.e. UX Design, Library Science, Data Analytics, and/or Consulting).
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Turn on email alerts for this search"</strong> - You'll see this note in the bottom left corner
              of the OCI and Job Listings page. Click on it to set up automatic email alerts for when new opportunities
              that align with your filters are posted.</li>

      <h2>Job/Internship Search FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>How can networking help with my job or internship search?</strong><br>
          Networking is often the key to uncovering unposted or “hidden” opportunities. Reach out to UMSI alumni through
          LinkedIn, ask for introductions from faculty, and attend UMSI or industry networking events. Even short
          conversations can help expand your options and market yourself effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How can I stand out in a competitive job or internship market?</strong><br>
          Tailor each application to match the job description, showcase relevant UMSI coursework, projects, and skills,
          build a strong digital presence, including an updated LinkedIn profile and online portfolio if applicable,
          prepare a compelling elevator pitch for networking situations, and practice interviewing with feedback from
          peers or career advisors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What should my timeline look like for applying?</strong><br>
          Begin searching early, as some fields recruit months in advance (especially tech and consulting). For roles
          that hire later or on a rolling basis, check job boards frequently and be ready to act when an opportunity
          appears.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Are cover letters important for information jobs and internships?</strong><br>
          Yes—many organizations expect a thoughtful cover letter, especially for research, library, archive, or UX
          roles. Use your letter to explain your passion for information, showcase relevant skills, and demonstrate your
          knowledge of the employer’s mission or projects.
        </li>
      </ul>
